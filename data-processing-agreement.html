                    <h3>3. Processor Personnel</h3>

                    <p>Processor shall take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of any employee, agent or contractor of any Contracted Processor who may have access to the Company Personal Data, ensuring in each case that access is strictly limited to those individuals who need to know / access the relevant Company Personal Data, as strictly necessary for the purposes of the Principal Agreement, and to comply with Applicable Laws in the context of that individual's duties to the Contracted Processor, ensuring that all such individuals are subject to confidentiality undertakings or professional or statutory obligations of confidentiality.</p>

                    <h3>4. Security</h3>

                    <p>Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Processor shall in relation to the Company Personal Data implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to that risk, including, as appropriate, the measures referred to in Article 32(1) of the GDPR.</p>

                        <li>(a) Processor maintains an up-to-date list of authorized Subprocessors, which is available at <a href="https://www.thread.app/subprocessors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.thread.app/subprocessors</a>;</li>
                        <li>(b) Processor provides the Company with at least 14 days' prior written notice of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Subprocessors, including details of the new Subprocessor's name, location, and the Processing activities it will perform;</li>
                        <li>(c) the Company may reasonably object to such changes on legitimate data protection grounds within 10 days of receiving notice; and</li>
                        <li>(d) Processor enters into a written agreement with each Subprocessor that imposes data protection obligations no less protective than those imposed on the Processor under this Agreement, including but not limited to equivalent obligations regarding security measures, data subject rights assistance, breach notification, audits, and data deletion/return. The Processor shall remain fully liable to the Company for the performance of any Subprocessor's obligations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Company hereby authorizes the Processor to engage the Subprocessors listed at <a href="https://www.thread.app/subprocessors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.thread.app/subprocessors</a> as of the effective date of this Agreement, subject to the Company's right to object as set out above.

                        <li>(b) ensure that it does not respond to that request except on the documented instructions of Company or as required by Applicable Laws to which the Processor is subject, in which case Processor shall to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws inform Company of that legal requirement before the Contracted Processor responds to the request.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>7. Personal Data Breach</h3>

                    <p>Processor shall provide reasonable assistance to the Company with any data protection impact assessments, and prior consultations with Supervising Authorities or other competent data privacy authorities, which Company reasonably considers to be required by article 35 or 36 of the GDPR or equivalent provisions of any other Data Protection Law, in each case solely in relation to Processing of Company Personal Data by, and taking into account the nature of the Processing and information available to, the Contracted Processors.</p>

                    <h3>9. Deletion or Return of Company Personal Data</h3>

                    <p>Subject to this section Processor shall promptly and in any event within 10 business days of the date of cessation of any Services involving the Processing of Company Personal Data (the "Cessation Date"), delete and procure the deletion of all copies of those Company Personal Data, except to the extent that the Processor is required by Applicable Laws to retain any Company Personal Data, in which case the Processor shall securely isolate such data and cease all further Processing except as required by law.</p>

                    <p>Processor shall provide written certification to Company that it has fully complied with this section within 10 business days of the Cessation Date.</p>

                    <h3>10. Audit Rights</h3>

                    <p>Subject to this section, Processor shall make available to the Company on request all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Agreement, and shall allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, by the Company or an auditor mandated by the Company in relation to the Processing of the Company Personal Data by the Contracted Processors.</p>

                    <p>Information and audit rights of the Company only arise under this section to the extent that the Agreement does not otherwise give them information and audit rights meeting the relevant requirements of Data Protection Law.</p>

                    <h3>11. Data Transfer</h3>

                    <p>The Processor shall ensure that any transfer of Company Personal Data to countries outside the EU and/or the European Economic Area (EEA) complies with Data Protection Laws. Where such transfers occur, the Processor shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as EU-approved standard contractual clauses or other approved mechanisms, and shall inform the Company of such safeguards upon request. Where Subprocessors are located outside the EEA, the Processor shall ensure that equivalent safeguards are in place.</p>

                    <h3>12. General Terms</h3>
